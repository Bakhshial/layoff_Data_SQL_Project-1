# layoff_Data_SQL_Project-1

Project Overview
This project involves the cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about company layoffs. The dataset is stored in a MySQL database and includes company names, locations, industries, total number of layoffs, and funds raised. The objective is to ensure data quality and derive meaningful insights through a structured data cleaning process and comprehensive EDA.

Repository Structure
Data_Cleaning_Process.sql: Contains the SQL script for cleaning the layoffs data.
Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql: Contains the SQL script for performing exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project, including instructions for running the scripts and descriptions of the data cleaning and EDA processes.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
MySQL client or any SQL IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to execute the scripts.

Setting Up
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layoffs-analysis.git
cd layoffs-analysis

Import the Database:

Could you make sure that the world_layoffs database is created and the layoffs table is filled with the necessary data?

Running the Scripts
Data Cleaning:

Execute the data_cleaning.sql script to clean the layoffs data:

sql
source Data_Cleaning_Process.sql;
This script will:

Remove duplicate records.
Standardize data values (e.g., trimming whitespace, standardizing names).
Handle null and blank values.
Remove unnecessary columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Execute the eda.sql script to perform EDA on the cleaned data:

SQL
Copy code
source Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql;
This script will:

Calculate basic statistics.
Identify trends and patterns in the data.
Summarize layoffs by various dimensions (e.g., company, industry, country, date).
